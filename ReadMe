Press play button to start
At the end of the simulation, in webots console, time and box output will be printed
How to use the pipeline

The pipeline is now integrated in the CarSup controller. By starting the simulation on you local machine, it will update wheel shape, run simulation, export data, and check at what time the car passed its furthest box.
Additional Information

Use Car4wA proto for the simulations. Other Protos are cars with different hard coded wheel shapes.
On line 12 of the Car4wA proto code file there is a 'controller' attribute. Change the name to 'CarCam' if image export is desired. The simulation takes longer if so. Use 'CarSup' if the full integration is desired (files not adjusted for servers). Use CarCon for a basic run.
json2overcome3 and json2proto3 are independent classes and can be used to run the individual parts of the pipeline.
CarSup controller implement an end to end pipeline.
How to create a Docker container to run Webots headlessly on a server

Log onto server
Update file paths in files
Use sftp to upload files to server
run in server: docker run -it cyberbotics/webots:latest
Transfer files to docker container docker cp FOLDER_FILE_PATH DOCKER_CONTAINER_ID:/usr/local/webots/COPIED_FOLDER
Run the simulation headlessly using xvfb-run webots --stdout --stderr --batch --mode=fast obstacleTesting2.wbt (Make sure you are in the worlds folder)
